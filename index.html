                        <p> A short and concise catalog of just some of former President Donald Trump's 
                            most abhorrant actions, words, and policies.  </p>
                        <p> With election season around the corner, it is pivotal to know just who 
                            you are voting for, and the type of man they are. We urge you, as a voter, to 
                            look through this record and see if this is the man who you think best represents
                            you and what you stand for.
