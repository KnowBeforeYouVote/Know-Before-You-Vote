                        A history of sexual assault
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        On top of his regular misogynistic rhetoric, Donald Trump has been
                        accused of rape, sexual assault, <br> and sexual harassment by at 
                        least 20 women since the 1970's. Below are some such accusations.
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            Jill Harth (1992):
                        </li>
                        <p style="margin-left:10px;">
                            In 1997, Harth filed a lawsuit wherein she accused Trump of
                            non-consentual groping <br> in December 1992. She and Trump
                            settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.

                            In November of 2022, Carrol was awarded $5 million in 
                            compensatory and punitive <br> damages on the grounds that 
                            she was sexually assaulted and then defamed by <br>
                             Donald J. Trump in 1996.

                            A contestant on the fifth season of, "The Apprentice," Zervos
                            alleges that Trump <br> sexually assaulted her on set. Zervos
                            filed a civil suit in 2017, which was continuously 
                            <br> pushed back until the date of 2021 on grounds that the 
                            President is immune to such <br> civil action. Zervos has since
                            dropped her claim.

                            In 2016 the New York Times got ahold of leaked audio recordings 
                            of then Republican <br> Presidential Nominee Donald Trump. In 
                            these tapes, he brags, among other things, <br> about sexually 
                            assaulting women:

                            "I moved on her. I did try and fuck her. And she was married. 
                            She wanted to get some <br> furniture. I said, “I’ll show you where 
                            they have some nice furniture.” And I moved <br> on her like a bitch."
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Later in the recordings:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            "I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t 
                            even wait. And when <br> you’re a star, they let you do it. You can

                            and a potentila <br> violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.
